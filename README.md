# EzMart - Django Ecommerce Web
A full-scale fullstack school project, a mock online platform for buying and selling goods.

## General Information
The site was inspired by the need to reduce the risk of shopping outside during the Covid-19 lockdown,
and as such aims to be a user-friendly platform for shopping and/or setting up a personal shop.
The platform enables users to browse local indie shops that cater to their day-to-day needs (such as foods, clothing, etc.)
while also being a lightweight user-friendly opportunity for shopowners to set up an online platform to sell their merchandise.

This was my group's project for the course "Basics of Software Engineering" that included a fullstack approach to coding, as well as extensive documentation in the form of a project charter. The tasks were tracked using Meistertask, and version control was done using Github.


# Technologies:
1. VSCode.
2. Django web framework.
3. Python 3.3 or later.
4. Django extensions - Attached is a Requirements file.


        
# Installation and running:
* The project files are under the 'master' branch. *
1. Install django and VSCode successfully on your machine. (Guides can be found online)
2. Create a designated folder for the project, make sure 'requirements.txt' is present in it.
3. Open your designated folder with a windows powershell/cmd (or linux equivalent), run the following commands:
    -m pip install -r requirements.txt		(Best to run as admin!)
4. At this point, if the project files aren't already present in the designated folder, copy them in.


# Running the project:

1. Open the folder in VSCode or CMD, navigate using the VSCode command shell (Or windows command shell) to the path containing
   the "manage.py" file.
2. In the shell (under the afformentioned path) run "python manage.py runserver".
3. This should result in the shell correctly displaying that the server is running, while linking the localhost IP address
   for the project: 127.0.0.1
4. Enter the IP in your local browser (preferably chrome), and browse the site! 

#Acknowledgements
This was part of my "Basics of Software Engineering" course, and as such I must thank my lecturer Ms. Hadas Chassidim.
## Status
No longer being worked on. This project was the first hands-on approach to fullstack coding our team had, and will stay with no further development as the members of the team moved on to other projects.
