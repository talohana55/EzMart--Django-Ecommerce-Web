      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries
      may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as

      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
